## Linked List
1) **Fast and Slow pointers**
    - Used for:
      - Finding midpoint
      - Finding kth node from the end
      - Determining whether list is a cycle
   - Fast ptr traverses the list faster than slow ptr does
     - usually Fast traverses two steps at a time, while slow does one step
